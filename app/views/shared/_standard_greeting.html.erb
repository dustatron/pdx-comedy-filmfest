       <strong>   WHAT’S SO DAMN FUNNY, PORTLAND?!? </strong> Well, we’ll tell ya. Your videos, that’s what!<br><br>
       
       <strong> PORTLAND’S FUNNIEST VIDEOS </strong> ain’t just another LAUGH ‘TIL YOU WET YOUR PANTS kinda evening.
        No, it’s much more than that. It’s a comedic, short-film competition EVERY DAMN MONTH at Curious Comedy Theater. <br><br>
        
        Maybe your video will win the Monthly Audience Choice award. Or, you’ll win a gag award <strong> EVERY DAMN MONTH </strong>.
        But one thing’s for sure. You’ll finally get your 15 seconds of fame. And, in March (every March) one of your 
        videos could win the title of Portland’s Funniest Video. <br><br>

         <strong>SO HOW DOES IT WORK? —</strong>
        <br><br>
        First, Portland film nerds accept the challenge to make Portland laugh. Next, they submit their funniest videos — 
        no more than 7 minutes long each. Then, their best creative work duke it out to WIN PRIZES at the event.
